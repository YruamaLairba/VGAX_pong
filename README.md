=VGAX_pong=

==Presentation==
This is my implementation of a pong using the 
[VGAX library](https://github.com/smaffer/vgax), be sure it's installed before
compiling the project. 

This project is not really finished but it's playable. Bars are controlled by 2
potentiometers. If the ball hit a bar edge, it will impose a special angle to
the ball.
